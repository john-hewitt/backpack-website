A **Backpack** is a drop-in replacement for a Transformer that provides new tools for **interpretability-through-control** while still enabling strong language models.

A Backpack model is a neural network that operates on sequences of symbols. It (1) learns a set of _sense vectors_ of meaning for each symbol, and (2) in context, weights and sums each sense vector of that context to represent each word of the sequence.

When training Backpack Language Models, we find that sense vectors specialize to represent fine-grained aspects of predictive utility for each word.
Intuitively, sense vectors **non-contextually specify the span of ways in which the word might be useful in context,** and the context decides what member of that span to take.

Because each sense vector represents a non-contextual log-probability vector, we say they have a **transparent** semantics.
The transparent connection between symbol meaning and model prediction enables new directions in interpretability and control.
This simplicity is enabled by the use of existing, opaque neural architectures (like the Transformer) _only in the role of generating weights for the sum_.
For one example of control in our ACL paper, we identify a source of gender bias in stereotypically gendered career nouns as being partially derived from a single sense vector, and "turn down" the weights on that sense to reduce bias:

The name "Backpack" is inspired by the fact that a backpack is like a bag---but more orderly. Like a bag-of-words, a Backpack representation is a sum of non-contextual senses, but a Backpack is more orderly, because the weights in this sum depend on the ordered sequence.

#### Demo a Backpack language model

- Visualize sense vectors [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lora-x/Backpack).
- Generate from and control a Backpack language model [here](#).

#### Train or finetune your own Backpacks
- Download and use our up-to-170M parameter models on [HuggingFace](#).
- To get the gist, use our simple implementation on Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT; [nanoBackpackGPT](#).
- Like JAX and TPUs? We have an implementation in JAX via Stanford's [Levanter library](#).
- Want to reproduce our ACL paper? Our original implementation is in FlashAttention, [here](#).
